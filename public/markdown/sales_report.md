# Sales report

Imagine that we work in the sales department of an export company. We offer cosmetic products for domestic and several foreign markets. Every month we receive information from sellers about the sales value, margin and quantity of products sold in a given market.  The spreadsheet is as follows:

Column B shows the months for which the data are given. Column C gives information on the country to which the data relate. Column D indicates the product category and column E indicates the product segment. Column F gives the brand name of the product. Columns G to L indicate the sales, profit and quantities sold for 2018 and 2019.

On this basis, we would like to prepare a sales report for the last two years to present the results of our department to management.

It should look like this:
