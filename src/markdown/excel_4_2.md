COUNTIF is a function that counts the number of cells in a range that meet a specific condition. 
For example, =COUNTIF(A1:A10, ">5") counts cells in the range A1:A10 that have values greater than 5.
	
SUMIF is a function that adds up the values in a range that meet a certain criterion. 
For example, =SUMIF(A1:A10, ">5") sums only the values in A1:A10 that are greater than 5.

CONDITIONS
Conditions are used to test specific criteria in formulas, often combined with functions like IF, COUNTIF, and SUMIF.

AND and OR are logical functions: AND returns TRUE if all conditions are met, while OR returns TRUE if at least one condition is met.

Comparison operators like >, <, >=, <=, == (equal to), and <> (not equal to) are used to compare values within formulas.
