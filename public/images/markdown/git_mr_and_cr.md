# Git Merge Requests and Code Reviews

In collaborative software development, managing code changes and ensuring code quality are critical. **Merge Requests** (also known as **Pull Requests** in some systems) and **Code Reviews** are two essential practices in Git that facilitate this process. They enable teams to review and discuss code changes before integrating them into the main codebase.
What is a Merge Request?

A Merge Request (MR) is a request to merge code changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch. The merge request serves several purposes:

1. **Discussion**: It allows team members to discuss the proposed changes, raise questions, and provide feedback.

2. **Review Process**: The merge request initiates a review process where peers can examine the code for quality, functionality, and adherence to coding standards.

3. **Integration**: Once approved, the changes can be merged into the target branch, often accompanied by automated checks (e.g., tests, linting) to ensure stability.

## Creating a Merge Request

Creating a merge request typically involves the following steps:

1. **Branch Creation**: A developer creates a new branch from the main branch to work on a specific feature or fix.

2. **Code Changes**: The developer makes changes in the new branch and commits them with descriptive messages.

3. **Push to Remote**: The developer pushes the branch to the remote repository.

4. **Open Merge Request**: The developer then opens a merge request through the version control platform (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), specifying the target branch (usually the main branch) and providing a description of the changes.

## Code Review Process

Once a merge request is created, the code review process begins:

1. **Assign Reviewers**: The developer can assign team members to review the merge request. Reviewers are responsible for checking the code for errors, style issues, and overall quality.

2. **Review Comments**: Reviewers can comment on specific lines of code, ask questions, and suggest improvements. This feedback helps ensure the code meets the team’s standards and expectations.

3. **Addressing Feedback**: The original developer may need to make changes based on reviewer comments. They can push additional commits to the branch to address the feedback, which automatically updates the merge request.

4. **Approval**: Once the reviewers are satisfied with the changes, they can approve the merge request. Some teams may require a certain number of approvals before merging.

5. **Merging**: After approval, the changes can be merged into the target branch. This step can often be performed through the version control platform’s interface.

6. **Closing the Merge Request**: After merging, the merge request is closed, and the feature branch can be deleted if no longer needed.
