## Household budget

In the first sheet we will enter data on expenses divided into categories and subcategories. The created worksheet will be quite a simple tool where we will enter the name of the expense, its value and we will choose the category and subcategory. It will look like this:

## How to start creating a home budget?

This practical example is about creating a simple tool to control the home budget. Depending on the needs of those using it, it can be a more powerful tool. The presented example of solving the problem is a universal household budget. It is used in the example:

- charts,
- the SUM function,
- subtraction,
- the SUMIFS function
- the INDIRECT function,
- data validation,
- conditional formatting,
- creating a name from a selection

**Rename the sheet**

**Remove the grid lines** (view -> gridlines)(optionally)

**Create the tables you need**

**Introduce the new formulas**
- =SUM (monthly income) (in some parts we will use the references to other cells)

**PLANNED COSTS ARE ALL COSTS FROM THE PLANNED COST COLUMNS**

- we use the SUM function, seperating the individual cell ranges

**We do the same with actual costs**
 
THE BALANCE SHEET IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INCOME AND COSTS
