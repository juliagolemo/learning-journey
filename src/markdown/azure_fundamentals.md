# Azure
```
The Azure platform offers four levels of management: management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.

## Management groups 
Management groups simplify managing access, policies, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

## Subscritions
Subscriptions logically link user accounts to the resources they create. Each subscription has limits or quota allocations regarding the amount of resources that can be created and used. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and resources created by users, teams, and projects.

## Resource Groups
Resource groups are logical containers where Azure resources, such as virtual machines, web applications, databases, and storage accounts, can be deployed and managed.

## Resource
Resources are instances of services that can be created within a resource group, such as virtual machines, storage, and SQL databases.
