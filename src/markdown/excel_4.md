# Excel - if_function
The “IF” function in Excel allows you to perform a logical test and return one value if the test is true and another value if it’s false. The basic syntax is:

=IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)

For example, if you want to check if a number in cell A1 is greater than 10, the function might look like:

=IF(A1>10, "Yes", "No")

This will return “Yes” if the condition is true (A1 > 10) and “No” if it’s false.
